# HASRA

A system for individualized training of group-housed mice in a single pellet reaching task.

Designed by Greg Silasi (gsilasi@uottawa.ca)

This system allows the user to host up to 5 mice in their home environment and automatically administer the single pellet reaching test to those animals. The system can run unsupervised and continuously for weeks at a time, allowing all 5 mice to perform an unlimited number of single pellet trials at their leisure.
